# RandomHaskell

A collection of random Haskell code. I sometimes like to create my own problems to solve,
if I think they're interesting or I could learn from them. So that's what this is.

Mostly, these will probably be single-file and not necessarily a comprehensive project.
The purpose of learning Haskell is merely to expand my horizons and learn something
new and unusual to me.
